# Contributing

Thank you for considering a contribution to ArCOM!

# How to contribute
1. Make a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) of the [master branch](https://github.com/sanworks/ArCOM) of ArCOM.
2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) your fork to create a local copy of it on your machine.
3. Make any updates or additions to the docs, and [commit](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits) the changes to your fork.
4. [Push](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository) your updated local fork to its remote location on Github.
5. Create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) for us to integrate your changes into the project.

# Style Guidelines
ArCOM aspires to comply with best practices as specified in Richard Johnson's [MATLAB Style Guidelines 2.0](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/46056-matlab-style-guidelines-2-0) for MATLAB code, and with PEP8 for Python. We recognize that neuroscience researchers are often beyond busy with research, and we do not want contributions to our tools be hindered in any way. If you are time constrained, please ensure that your contributed code works as intended, and we will make any necessary style edits on our part before the next stable release.

- Note: If you have access to OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 or equivalent, much of the heavy lifting for style compliance can be achieved with a simple prompt (e.g. for MATLAB): ```Please format the following MATLAB code to comply with with Richard Johnson's MATLAB Style Guidelines 2.0:```, followed by your code. The output must be validated, keeping in mind that large language models occasionally hallucinate. Also, any formatting of user-facing function names, method names or property names must be reverted or handled to preserve backwards compatibility with existing behavior protocol code.
